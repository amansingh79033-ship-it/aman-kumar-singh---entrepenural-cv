This is a placeholder file for the Sufi flute and sitar background music.

To implement the actual background music:

1. Replace this file with an actual audio file named "sufi-flute-sitar.mp3"
2. The audio should feature:
   - Soulful Sufi flute melodies
   - Complementary sitar accompaniment
   - Loopable format for continuous playback
   - Mild volume level (around 20%)
   - Duration of at least 30 seconds for seamless looping

The current implementation will fall back to a silent audio when this file is not present.
